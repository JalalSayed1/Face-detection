# Face-detection
## About the project:
- It takes user's camera as an input, discovers faces and eyes in the video and draws a rectangle around their location.
- It finds faces using OpenCV models in "haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml" and eyes in "haarcascade_eye.xml".
- To exit the program after running it, press 'ESC' on your keyboard.

## What did i learn from this:
- How to use Video files or user camera using OpenCV.
- How to use detectMultiScale and coverting image captured to gray scale to be able to find faces and eyes in them.
- How to draw a rectangle to the output video.
- How to exit the program when user presses a certain key.
- How to release resounces before closing the program.
